Reliquary Lite
=========

Description
=========

The offical repository of Reliquary Lite! This is a cut down version of Reliquary containing only basic features.
The intent is to create a version of Reliquary which has the updated versions of all of the cool items without the "beta"
features such as the new potion crafting system, etc.

Hats off to x3n0ph0b3 and TheMike for creating the original Reliquary.

Building
=========

We use ForgeGradle. There are instructions inside the 'build.gradle' file in this repository.

Versioning
=========

Every major version increase means a Minecraft version increase. 1.1.x is for 1.6.4. 1.2.x will be for Minecraft 1.7. 1.3 will be for Minecraft 1.8. And so on. 

Licence
=========

The licence is located at COPYING.txt, but to save you the trouble, it's GPLv3 (with one of the sounds under CC Attribution License). 

Basically, do whatever you want, as long as it's free, open source, and stays under GPL. (Yes, that allows you to use it in your modpack.)
